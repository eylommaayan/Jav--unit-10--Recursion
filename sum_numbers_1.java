 * Certainly! Let's go through the Java code provided step-by-step to explain what each part does:

### Code Explanation:
This Java code defines a class called `sum_numbers_1` which contains a method to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` using a recursive approach. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code components:

#### Class Definition:
```java
public class sum_numbers_1 {
```
- **Class Name**: `sum_numbers_1`
- **Access Modifier**: `public` - The class is accessible from any other class.

#### Main Method:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(sumNumbers(5));  // Will print 15
}
```
- **Method Name**: `main` - It's the entry point of any Java program.
- **Parameters**: `String[] args` - Array of strings which stores arguments passed by command line (not used in this example).
- **Functionality**: Calls the `sumNumbers` function with the input 5 and prints the result. In this case, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 and prints 15.

#### Recursive Function `sumNumbers`:
```java
public static int sumNumbers(int n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;  // Base case: if n is 1, return 1
    } else {
        return n + sumNumbers(n - 1);  // Recursive step: return n plus the sum of numbers up to n-1
    }
}
```
- **Function Signature**: `public static int sumNumbers(int n)`
  - **`public`**: The method is accessible from other classes.
  - **`static`**: The method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
  - **`int`**: Return type of the method, which is an integer.
  - **`n`**: Parameter of type `int`, representing the last number in the range to be summed.
- **Base Case**: `if (n == 1) { return 1; }`
  - This is the simplest case which directly answers the problem without further recursion. If `n` is 1, the sum of all integers from 1 to 1 is simply 1.
- **Recursive Case**: `else { return n + sumNumbers(n - 1); }`
  - If `n` is not 1, the function calls itself with `n - 1` and adds `n` to the result. This continues until the base case is reached. For example, `sumNumbers(5)` would calculate `5 + sumNumbers(4)`, and `sumNumbers(4)` would in turn calculate `4 + sumNumbers(3)`, and so forth until `sumNumbers(1)` returns 1.

#### Conceptual Flow:
- When `sumNumbers(5)` is called, it recursively calls itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches the base case `n == 1`.
- Each call to `sumNumbers` waits for the result of its recursive call to complete, at which point it adds `n` to the returned value and passes the result back up the call stack, ultimately returning the sum to the `main` method which prints it out.

This method of recursive calculation is a classic demonstration of both the power and potential pitfalls of recursion, as it can be both elegantly simple and inefficient for larger values of `n` due to the high number of function calls.
